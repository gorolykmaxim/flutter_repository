# DDD repositories for Flutter

Collection-oriented implementation of DDD repositories.

## Why flutter_repositories?

This project should help you better integrate object-oriented principles 
into your applications, by facilitating modeling of your application's 
domain model, creating classes, that represent actual concepts of your 
domain model, which are understood even by your end-users.
